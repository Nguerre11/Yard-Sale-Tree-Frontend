This is a guide and file is used for efficently learning throught ecoding tecniques (I use Open AI for learning, its awesome tool! )

##Workflow 
1 Planning system 
    Assign syllabus to Excel spreadsheet
    Estimate hours per syllabus including margin of error (reviews - practice)
2.Pre-learning system (1 layer encoding) [1H]
    Select Index Global 
    Separate them by global themes (Git - GitHub)
    Create an accurate index of the themes (class-until-class number)
3.Atopic learning [2H] 
    Review Videos El  (don't need this step for this course)
    Analysis ‚Üí creation of high-level learning hypotheses 
        Review Open AI 
        Why is it important? 
        Can I relate them? 
        Can I simplify them? 
        Can I categorize them into fragments? 
        I've finished Big Picture? (I've just create relations on this folder, don't draw organization system)

Learning Workflow (2 layer encoding) [+20H] if Class==conceptual-comprehension, else omit it
    1.Trends Index (not necesary)
        Video 2.0X
        a.Identify where is "conceptual comprehension" 
        b. Apply high order learning encoding (do not
        memorize or understand, relate, compare and
        organize)
        b. Identify the key points
        c. I stop it when I've got "conceptual comprehension"
        Code within the organization system (Big Picture) (layer 1)
    2.Atopic learning (Quick review of multiple sources) if Class==code-comprehension
        Review Forum
        Select Summary
        Understand it
        Use Open AI to reinforce
        Reinforce Big Picture (layer 2)
    3.Comprehension Workflow and practical application
        Divide Big Picture - Workflow by theme
        Video 1.0X"
        Focus on comprehension  "code comprehension"
        Relate and create a 1-layer coding workflow
        Program at the end of class. !important
    4.Design Workflow coding 2 layer + Accumulative project (optional)
        Step-by-step system of a definitive goal    
        Design Workflow .js files and readme
        Create documentation based on this.
    5. Feedback Loop What did u useful?
        Tranlate throught Open AI
        English Open AI
        Relate things to pre-learning progress
        View once video 1.0X
        test code throughtout of class
        practique-end
        Organizacion system by colors

##Workflow coding üìë
    ###Functions
        function declaration
        bunch of code will be executed 
        invoke the function
    ###Conditions if
        Conditions declaration
        value false or true 
        bear bloq code if its true 
    ##Loops for 
    for (initialization; condition; iteration) { code to be executed
    for (variable of iterable of Arrays) {// code to be executed
    ##Arrays recorridos (complex)
        are methods used for filter, they dont modifique the main arrays
        var.complexArray= mainArray(function);
